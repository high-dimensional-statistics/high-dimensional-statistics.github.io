Say there is another psd kernel $$\tilde{k}$$ which satisfies the reproducing
property: $$\forall x \, , \tilde{k}(\cdot, x) \in \mathbb{H}$$, and
$$f(x) = \langle f , \tilde{k}(\cdot, x) \rangle$$ for all $$x$$ and
$$f \in \mathbb{H}$$. Then by applying the reproducing property repeatedly
\begin{align}
  k(x, x')
  =
  \langle
    k(\cdot, x)
    ,
    k(\cdot, x')
  \rangle
  =
  \langle
    k(\cdot, x)
    ,
    \tilde{k}(\cdot, x')
  \rangle
  =
  \langle
    \tilde{k}(\cdot, x)
    ,
    \tilde{k}(\cdot, x')
  \rangle
  =
  \tilde{k}(x, x')
  \, ,
\end{align}
for any two $$x, x'$$, i.e., the two kernels are equal.
