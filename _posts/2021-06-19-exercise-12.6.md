The kernel integral operator for the linear kernel $$k$$ is equal to
\begin{align}
  T_k (f) (x)
  =
  \int
    \langle x, z \rangle
    f(z)
    \isd \P(z)
  =
  \bigl\langle x , \int z f(z) \isd \P(z) \bigr\rangle
  \, ,
\end{align}
for any $$f \in L^2 (\P)$$. Therefore we can find a basis for $$T_k$$ by taking
functions of the form $$\phi_j (x) = \langle v_j , x \rangle$$ with
$$ v_j \in S^{d - 1}$$ an orthonormal basis for $$\R^d$$. The vectors $$v_j$$
can then be obtained by eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix:
\begin{align}
  \int z \phi_j(z) \isd \P(z)
  =
  \int z z^\top \isd \P(z) \, v_j
  \, .
\end{align}
