Since we do not know if $$f^\star \in \F_C$$, we consider
$$\partial \F = \F_C - \F_C \subseteq \F_{2C}$$ to get an upper bound.
Using
\begin{align}
  \log N\_n(t ; B\_n(\delta ; \F\_{2C}))
  \lesssim
  \log N\_\infty(t ; \F\_{2C})
  \, ,
\end{align}
and the fact that boundedness of derivatives implies Lipschitzness with the same constant, we can invoke the result from Example 5.11 with $$\alpha = \gamma = 1$$
\begin{align}
  \log N\_\infty(t ; \F\_{2C})
  \asymp
  t^{-1/2}
  \, .
\end{align}
We can thus proceed analogously to Example 13.11 to obtain the result.
