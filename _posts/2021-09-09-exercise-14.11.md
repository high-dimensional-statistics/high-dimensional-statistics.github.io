Consider the minimisation of $\norm{f - f^\*}\_2^2$ over $f = \sum\_{m=1}^T \beta\_m \phi\_m$ where $\beta \in \R^T$ is such that $\norm{\beta}\_1 = 1$.
First, we omit the constraint that $\norm{\beta}\_1 = 1$, perform the unconstrained optimisation, and show that the constraint actually holds at the optimum, which means that we also solved the constrained problem.
Without the constraint, using $L^2[0, 1]$-orthonormality of $(\phi\_m)\_{m=1}^T$, it follows that $\beta^\*\_m = \lra{f^\*, \phi\_m}\_2 \ge 0$.
Therefore,
\begin{equation}
    \norm{\beta^\*}\_1 = \sum\_{m=1}^T \lra{f^\*, \phi\_m}\_2 = \lra{f^\*, 1}\_2 = 1,
\end{equation}
because $f^\*$ is a density on $[0, 1]$ and hence integrates to one.
Next, using $1$-Lipschitz continuity of $f^\*$, for any $m \in [T]$ and $x \in (m - 1, m]/T$, it is true that
\begin{equation}
    |f(x) - f^\*(x)| = |f^\*(x) - \lra{f^\*, \phi\_m}\_2| \le \frac{1}{T}.
\end{equation}
Therefore, $\inf\_{f \in \F} \norm{f - f^\*}\_2^2 \le 1/T^2$.
For the critical radius, the usual parametric rate applies: $\delta^2\_n \propto T/n$.
Setting $T \propto n^{1/3}$ in Corollary 14.24 then gives the result.
