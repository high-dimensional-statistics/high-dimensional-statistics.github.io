Consider a $\delta$-packing.
Then the $\tfrac12 \delta$-balls do not intersect.
Hence, the total number of elements in the union of those balls is at most $2^d$.
Set $\tilde\delta = 2\lfloor\tfrac12 \delta d\rfloor/d \le \delta$.
Then
\begin{equation}
    M(\delta) \sum_{i=1}^{\tilde\delta d/2} \binom{d}{i} \le 2^d
    \iff
    \log M(\delta)
    \le - \log \sum_{i=1}^{\tilde\delta d/2} \binom{d}{i} 2^{-d}
    = - \log \P(Z_d \le \tfrac12 \tilde\delta d)
\end{equation}
where $Z_d$ is the sum of $d$ $\Ber(\tfrac12)$ variables.
Therefore, by the lower bound from [Exercise 2.10]({% post_url 2020-08-24-exercise-2.10 %}),
\begin{equation}
    \frac1d \log M(\delta)
    \le \KL(
        \tfrac12 \tilde\delta, \tfrac12
    ) + \frac1d \log(d + 1).
\end{equation}
<span class="accent">
    The above derivation is valid but upper bounds by $\tilde\delta$ rather than by $\delta$!
    It is possible to upper bound $\KL(\tfrac12 \tilde\delta, \tfrac12)$ by some multiple of $\KL(\tfrac12 \delta, \tfrac12)$ using that $\tilde \delta$ and $\delta$ are close, but this would yield a worse bound than required.
