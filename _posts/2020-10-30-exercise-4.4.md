## (a)

For any $$g \in \mathscr{G}$$, $$g(X) \leq |g(X)|$$ a.s. Taking expectation of
both sides
\begin{align}
  \E [g(X)] \leq \E [\sup\_{g \in \mathscr{G}} |g(X)|] \, .
\end{align}
Because this holds for all $$g \in \mathscr{G}$$, we can conclude by taking the
supremum over the left-hand side.

To proof the inequality in equation (4.17), use the Jensen's inequality to pull
the expectation over $$Y$$ outside of the absolute value, and then apply the
above result.


## (b)

For any $$g \in \mathscr{G}$$,
$$\Phi(\E|g(X)|) \leq \Phi(\E [\sup_{g \in \mathscr{G}} |g(X)|])$$
because $$\Phi$$ is increasing. Since $$\Phi$$ is also convex, the result
follows by the Jensen's inequality.

In the proof of Proposition 11, use the Jensen's inequality to pull the expectaion over $$Y$$ outside of the absolute value again.
