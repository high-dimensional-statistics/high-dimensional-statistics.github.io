## (a)
Let $$\gamma$$ be a functional that is continuous in $$\norm{\vardot}_\infty$$ at $$F$$.
By the Glivenko--Cantelli theorem, $$\norm{\hat F_n - F}_\infty \to 0$$ almost surely, so $$\abs{\gamma(F_n) - \gamma(F)} \to 0$$ almost surely, hence also in probability.

## (b)
### (i)
The mean functional is *not* continuous.
Consider $$F = \ind_{[0, \infty)}$$ and
\begin{equation}
    F_n
    =
        \parens{1 - \tfrac{1}{n}} \ind_{[0, \infty)}
        +  \tfrac{1}{n} \ind_{[n, \infty)}.
\end{equation}
Then $$F$$ has mean $$0$$, $$F_n$$ has mean $$1$$, and $$\norm{F - F_n}_\infty \to 0$$.

### (ii)
The CramÃ©r--von Mises functional is continuous.
For this, see that
\begin{equation}
    (F - F_0)^2 - (G - F_0)^2
    = (F + G)(F - G) - 2F_0(F - G)
    \le 4 \norm{F - G}_\infty
    \to 0.
\end{equation}

### (iii)
The quantile function is also continuous, but only if we assume that $F(x) > \alpha$ for all $x > Q_\alpha(F)$.
Note that
\begin{equation}
    x < Q_\alpha(F) \iff F(x) < \alpha, \qquad
    x \ge Q_\alpha(F) \iff F(x) \ge \alpha.
\end{equation}
Let $\e > 0$.
Then
\begin{equation}
    \abs{x - Q_\alpha(F)} \le \e
    \impliedby x - \e < Q_\alpha(F) \le x + \e
    \iff F(x - \e) < \alpha \le F(x + \e).
\end{equation}
Thus, we desire to show that
\begin{equation}
    F(Q_\alpha(F_n) - \e) < \alpha \le F(Q_\alpha(F_n) + \e).
\end{equation}
Alternatively, we could show that
\begin{equation}
    F_n(Q_\alpha(F) - \e) < \alpha \le F_n(Q_\alpha(F) + \e).
\end{equation}
This turns out to be easier.

First, we will show that $F_n(Q_\alpha(F) + \e) \ge \alpha$.
Note that
\begin{equation}
    F_n(Q_\alpha(F) + \e) \ge
    F(Q_\alpha(F) + \e) - \norm{F - F_n}.
\end{equation}
Since, by assumption, $F(Q_\alpha(F) + \e) > \alpha$ (the strict inequality is important here),
we can make $n$ large enough to find $F_n(Q_\alpha(F) + \e) > \alpha$.
The other inequality $F_n(Q_\alpha(F) - \e) < \alpha$ follows similarly.
