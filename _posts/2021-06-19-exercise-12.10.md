Since $$S$$ is finite, we can encode each subset $$ A \subseteq S $$ as a binary
string $$\phi(A) = [\ind \{ s \in A \} ]_{s \in S} \in \{ 0, 1 \}^{|S|}$$. Hence
$$k(A, B) = 2^{\tilde{k} (A, B)}$$ for any two subset $$A, B$$, where
$$\tilde{k}(A, B) = \langle \phi(A), \phi(B) \rangle$$ is a valid kernel.
We can thus use the Maclaurin series
\begin{align}
  k(A, B)
  =
  \sum\_{j=0}^\infty
    \frac{(\log 2)^j}{j !}
    \tilde{k} (A, B)^j
  \, ;
\end{align}
because $$\frac{(\log 2)^j}{j !} \geq 0$$ and $$\tilde{k} (A, B)^j$$ is a psd
kernel for every $$j$$, $$k$$ is a pointwise limit of psd kernels, which is
itself psd since the cone of psd matrices is
